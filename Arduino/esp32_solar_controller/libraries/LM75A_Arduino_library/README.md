# LM75A

 LM75A is a temperature sensor communicating over the I2C protocol.

The NXP version of LM75A has 11 significant bits of the temperature, which gives a 
resolution of 0.125 째C. The standard version only uses 9 bits, which gives a resuolution 
of 0.5 째C.

I2C address span is 0x48 - 0x4F, and is set with pins A0/A1/A2.

Power up mode:
 - Comparator mode
 - Tos = 80 째C
 - Thyst = 75 째C
 - OS active low

Pin 3 is the OS (overtemperature shutdown). It can be used to to trigger a pin interrupt.
Set the functional mode, Tos and Thyst if you want to use this.
